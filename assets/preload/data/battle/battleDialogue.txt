:zerohuh:...
:monikagasp:Well this isn't where I was supposed to end up.
:selangry:faceright:Shit! How the hell did this happen?
:zerohuh:Well in one way or another, you both somehow ended up in my world.
:zerohuh:...
:zero:I notice you two have microphones with you.
:zero:Are you guys perhaps interested in singing?
:monikaright:Usually, I'd play piano while I sing, but I do have some experience singing without it.
:monikagaspright:I was actually singing with a couple of friends just a while ago.
:zero:Interesting.
:zero:What about you, other guy?
:selupset:faceright:Name's Selever btw and yeah I do have some experience singing.
:zero:Well then how about a lil rap battle between the two of you?
:zerosmile:I wanna see what you guys got.
:monikahappyright:Sure. I'd love to.
:sel:faceright:Beats being in the Nothing World so why not?
:selupset:faceright:Just keep in mind that I kinda inherited my father's trait of not being able to keep my voice steady for long periods of time.
:zerosmile:Alright, lemme get some music ready.
:selupset:faceright:I just have one more question.
:selangry:faceright:Why are you pixelated?
:shadowman:Making new portraits for an HD Monika is too much of a hassle.
:monikaangry:WHAT THE!?
:shadowman:Heh. Thought that'd surprise ya.
:shadowman:See ya!
:seltf:You know that guy?
:monikaangryright:He interrupted my singing session earlier too!
:selsmile:Ha
:sel:Cool
